Our micro-guided missile system is man-portable, multi-domain capable, and has both forward-deployed and low-collateral defeat variants. It senses, engages, and eliminates threats with drastically reduced cost per engagement.

Solving this critical national security problem requires understanding complex DoD needs along with actual rocket science including aerodynamics, guidance, navigation, control, and much more. Jason and Steve met at Penn State while they pursued a PhD and MS in aerospace engineering, respectively. Their past experiences designing space helicopters for NASA, making Boeing airliners land autonomously, controlling swarms of unmanned autonomous systems, teaching aerospace engineering at Stanford, winning multiple ONR and DOE engineering competitions, and founding an international drone competition makes them the perfect team to create transformative solutions protecting our service members.

The problem we solve: frontline managers waste hours interviewing candidates who quit before training ends. With 100%+ annual turnover, hiring becomes a daily firefight of filling shifts with whoever shows up.

We use AI voice interviewers that run first-round phone screenings. But we don't stop at screening; our AI also monitors new hires through check-in calls during their critical first 90 days to detect early attrition signals and flag these for managers to prevent it.

This creates a learning loop. The screening AI gets smarter with each placement, learning to recognize which candidates will stick around versus those who will leave early. Over time, this means fewer bad hires and less turnover.

The result: managers stop wasting time on candidates who won't last, cost per hire drops as turnover decreases, and shifts get covered by people who actually want to be there.

Our founding team has built voice AI products at HappyRobot, scaled infrastructure at Uber for millions of users, and applied data science at Netflix to solve operational challenges.

1) High quality datasets for benchmarking and evaluations
2) Realistic sandbox environments for safe and accurate testing/training (ex. a simulated version of Salesforce)

Halluminate offers a suite of products and services to address both these issues.

Our evaluation service combines proprietary datasets with high quality annotations to help our customers identify and prioritize the biggest failure modes of their computer- and browser- use AI.

Our platform provides an AI co-pilot that automatically assembles context across tools, a no-code agent builder that transforms successful investigations into reusable automations, and automated report generation, providing comprehensive documentation in seconds.

Unlike solutions that force teams to adapt to vendor workflows, Cotool puts the power of AI directly in practitioners' hands, letting them shape tools around their unique processes. Early users have already cut time spent on investigation and detection engineering by 70%.",2025-07-07T00:10:26.521950

With Besimple, you can generate your own platform for annotating AI evaluation and training data instantly. Simply paste or stream any type of raw data‚Äîtext, chat, audio, video, or LLM outputs‚Äîand we'll instantly generate a tailored annotation interface, clear guidelines, and an automated human-in-the-loop workflow. Our AI Judges quickly learn from human annotations, take over labeling for easy cases, and evaluate live production data, letting your team focus only on critical edge cases.

Key differentiators
1. Instant custom UI - Automatically generate tailored annotation interfaces just by uploading your data. Adjust easily whenever data or needs change.
2. Tailored guidelines ‚Äì Import any existing guidelines or we will draft new ones aligned with your business goals, ready for annotation
3. AI Judges for real-time evaluation ‚Äì AI-powered judges continuously improve by learning human preferences, automatically labeling data and flagging tough cases for expert review.

5. Lightning-Fast Setup: No code, no plugins‚Äîjust drop in your data, set guidelines, and you‚Äôre good to go.

Today we power evaluation and training pipelines for leading AI companies in customer support, search, education, and more. For example, the leading AI grading company Edexia uses besimple to annotate hundreds of decisions and improve their evals.

We‚Äôve built a full-stack platform on top of the latest NVIDIA GPUs offering confidential computing capabilities, meaning that you don‚Äôt have to tradeoff performance for privacy.

Under the hood, we integrate a suite of recent advances in secure hardware technologies, in particular NVIDIA‚Äôs confidential compute mode available on Hopper and Blackwell. When combined with Tinfoil‚Äôs software stack, companies can prove their security claims rather than relying on unenforceable statements like ""trust us, we don‚Äôt log your queries.‚Äù Tinfoil guarantees that all data always stays private and cannot be accessed by anyone other than the end user ‚Äî not even by Tinfoil or the cloud provider it‚Äôs processed on.

The founding team combines deep academic and industry experience in security and internet protocols. Tanya was previously a systems engineer at Cloudflare, where she built Internet security protocols used by billions, and contributed to the Workers AI platform. Jules and Sacha recently completed their PhDs at MIT where they worked on secure hardware and privacy-preserving technologies. Jules has also worked at NVIDIA on their confidential computing team. Nate has deep infrastructure experience, starting in high school when he built a mini-CDN that got him an internship at Cloudflare. Tinfoil was born from our personal frustration with the false choice between access to powerful AI and data privacy.

As AI becomes tightly integrated into our lives and business workflows, it will touch an ever increasing amount of sensitive personal and proprietary data. Right now, the only solutions are DPAs, band-aids like PII redaction, or the nuclear option of running everything on-prem. These solutions are not scalable. By making it easy to deploy provable privacy, Tinfoil promises to unlock significantly deeper AI adoption and integrations, just as TLS on the Internet enabled e-commerce to flourish by securing credit cards on the network.

1. analyze them for actionable takeaways, deal blockers, and nice to haves
2. consolidate them and manage all the asks with citations
3. prioritize them by impact and frequency to cut through the noise so you can see the biggest opportunities clearly
4. connect them to your existing strategic roadmap so when the work gets done, we can automatically follow back up with your customers and win them over

As AI enables developers to write code faster than ever, slow builds are increasingly becoming the bottleneck in development velocity. Developers regularly lose hours of productivity every day waiting for their builds. Imagine being able to write code in 1 minute, but needing to wait 30 minutes to compile, deploy, and test it.

Existing solutions either require painful migrations to new tools (e.g. Bazel) or rely on just using bigger servers to run your builds. Instead, we do native, first-class integrations into compilers and build systems.

With Attune, you don't need to integrate a new tool. Just make a one-line change from `cargo build` to `hurry cargo build` for 20x faster builds.

Eliza (ex-Google) and Xin worked together for 3 years at FOSSA, where Eliza was Head of Engineering and Xin was Head of Product. Eliza brings a decade of programming languages and build systems expertise, while Xin brings a decade of experience building developer tools products, most recently as VP of Product at Teleport (S15).

We're transforming how Medicare agencies handle member relationships with teams of voice AI agents. We're solving the industry's biggest challenge: 50% annual member churn caused by poor post-enrollment engagement.

Our multi-agent AI teams work together to handle the entire customer journey - from initial contact through enrollment and ongoing care. When a lead comes in after hours, one AI agent answers and schedules a callback, another calls at the perfect time, a third captures qualifying information, and a fourth handles the warm transfer to a licensed agent. This approach helped a leading FMO write over $2M in renewals during AEP 2024 while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale.

We've pioneered a purpose-built solution for Medicare's unique compliance requirements. Unlike generic AI platforms, our system features built-in HIPAA/CMS compliance, real-time data structuring, and seamless CRM integration. This enables agencies of all sizes to deliver enterprise-grade member care without massive infrastructure investments.

Early metrics show the power of our approach:

- 5x increase in after-hours conversion rates
- 37% improvement in 90-day retention
- 3,000+ agent hours saved in a single AEP
- $2M+ in additional renewals during AEP 2024

In Ukraine, $500 modified commercial drones regularly neutralize million-dollar military assets. At our southern border, cartels use drones to smuggle fentanyl and survey law enforcement positions. Critical infrastructure, military bases, and correctional facilities face unprecedented vulnerability to unauthorized surveillance and drone-based attacks.

Founded in 2024, Guardian RF develops advanced RF spectrum sensors to protect against this evolving threat landscape. Our technology has been battle-tested in Ukraine, where consumer drones converted into precise guided missiles have become a daily reality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on regulatory compliance, our sensors can detect modified and non-Remote ID compliant drones from up to 3 km away, accurately pinpointing both drone and operator locations.

What sets us apart is our distributed mesh network of sensors combining advanced Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology with AI-driven signal classification. Trained on extensive combat zone datasets, our system processes RF signatures in real-time across multiple frequency bands, catching even sophisticated stealth drones using frequency-hopping protocols. When a threat is detected, the system delivers precise targeting data while maintaining continuous tracking.

Our product line includes:
- Scout Detector: A handheld drone detector for rapid deployment and portability
- Mosaic Sensor Network: A scalable mesh network of RF sensors for detecting, tracking, and mapping drone activity across expansive areas

The stakes are severe: along our borders, cartel drones facilitate trafficking that costs thousands of lives annually. In prisons, a single successful drone contraband delivery can trigger facility-wide violence. For critical infrastructure, a coordinated drone strike could cause billions in business interruption losses. Traditional drone defense systems, often priced in the millions, are cost-prohibitive for most organizations.

Guardian RF bridges this critical gap with accessible, effective protection. Our AI classification engine recognizes various control protocols including modified ExpressLRS, Crossfire, and DJI variants, providing early warning of threats that traditional systems miss entirely. The system's fully automated detection, tracking, and response mechanisms ensure continuous protection with minimal operational overhead.

Built and manufactured in the United States, Guardian RF combines field-proven technology with real-world deployment experience to counter modern drone threats. Whether safeguarding critical infrastructure, securing borders, or supporting defense operations, our systems deliver the comprehensive drone detection capabilities needed for today's security challenges.",2025-07-07T01:19:10.002114

ReactWise,reactwise,2024,Summer 2024,2,Active,San Francisco,,https://www.reactwise.com/,['SAN FRANCISCO'],"Our Mission:
We aim to accelerate and automate chemical process development by equipping wet-lab chemists with the power of data-driven optimization and robotic execution of experiments.

The Problem:
The discovery of novel pharmaceuticals is one of our most important weapons in fighting disease. However, the drug development pipeline is often held up for many months during the design of chemical processes to manufacture these drugs at scale, delaying FDA trials and lengthening the time until drug launch. Designing chemical processes involves the identification of suitable parameters such as catalyst/temperature/solvent. Currently process development is often done via tedious trial-and-error experimentation (slow) or exhaustive screening (expensive and wasteful).

Our Approach:

Azalea Robotics provides state-of-the-art robotic systems that enhance efficiency, reduce mishandling, and improve passenger experience through more reliable operations.

Baggage handling is a critical component of airline ground operations, yet it is fraught with challenges. The work is physically demanding, often leading to long-term injuries among workers. Traditional baggage handling involves repetitive lifting and maneuvering of heavy loads, which can result in long-term health issues. Azalea Robotics addresses these challenges by automating the most strenuous tasks, thereby reducing the risk of injury and enhancing operational efficiency.",2025-07-07T01:26:45.195256
